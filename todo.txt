1. remove constants from actions??

2. convert celcius to farenheight

3. maybe add in a list of prepopulated cities?
Create a reducer that fires when the page loads that pulls in multiple cities

4. A way to delete cities? Maybe just double click? Yes! Also edit the placeholder with instructions?

5. Responsive Title (just reduce font). Also hide a column on smaller devices.

6. Maybe bring in a flight delay thing: http://services.faa.gov/docs/services/airport/

7. Testing

8. Clean up file directory / webpack / package.json

9. Deploy :)
